A plugin to connect to Steam Friends/Steam IM.

As of version 1.0 the (new) plugin will connect to Steam **without Steam running** via the Steam mobile API and thus works on Linux and OSX.

Versions less than 1.0 of this plugin use [Open Steamworks](http://opensteamworks.org/) to connect to a running copy of Steam.
